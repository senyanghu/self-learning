1. Power Of Two

Determine if a given integer is power of 2.

Examples

16 is power of 2 (2 ^ 4)
3 is not
0 is not
-1 is not


public class Solution {
  public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int number) {
    // Write your solution here.
    return false;
  }
}


2.Number Of Different Bits
Determine the number of bits that are different for two given integers.

Examples

5(“0101”) and 8(“1000”) has 3 different bits


public class Solution {
  public int diffBits(int a, int b) {
    // Write your solution here.
    return 0;
  }
}


3.All Unique Characters II
Determine if the characters of a given string are all unique.

Assumptions

We are using ASCII charset, the value of valid characters are from 0 to 255
The given string is not null
Examples

all the characters in "abA+\8" are unique
"abA+\a88" contains duplicate characters

public class Solution {
  public boolean allUnique(String word) {
    // write your solution here
    return false;
  }
}



4.Hexadecimal Representation

Generate the hexadecimal representation for a given non-negative integer number as a string. The hex representation should start with "0x".

There should not be extra zeros on the left side.

Examples

0's hex representation is "0x0"
255's hex representation is "0xFF"

public class Solution {
  public String hex(int number) {
    // Write your solution here.
    return "";
  }
}
