1.Largest SubArray Sum

Given an unsorted integer array, find the subarray that has the greatest sum. Return the sum.

Assumptions

The given array is not null and has length of at least 1.
Examples

{2, -1, 4, -2, 1}, the largest subarray sum is 2 + (-1) + 4 = 5

{-2, -1, -3}, the largest subarray sum is -1

public class Solution {
  public int largestSum(int[] array) {
  }
  }


2.Longest Consecutive 1s
Given an array containing only 0s and 1s, find the length of the longest subarray of consecutive 1s.

Assumptions

The given array is not null
Examples

{0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0}, the longest consecutive 1s is 3.

public class Solution {
  public int longest(int[] array) {
    // Write your solution here.
    return 0;
  }
}



3.Longest Cross Of 1s

Given a matrix that contains only 1s and 0s, find the largest cross which contains only 1s, with the same arm lengths and the four arms joining at the central point.

Return the arm length of the largest cross.

Assumptions

The given matrix is not null, has size of N * M, N >= 0 and M >= 0.
Examples

{ {0, 0, 0, 0},

  {1, 1, 1, 1},

  {0, 1, 1, 1},

  {1, 0, 1, 1} }

the largest cross of 1s has arm length 2.

public class Solution {
  public int largest(int[][] matrix) {
    // Write your solution here.
    return 0;
  }
}



4.Largest X Of 1s
Given a matrix that contains only 1s and 0s, find the largest X shape which contains only 1s, with the same arm lengths and the four arms joining at the central point.

Return the arm length of the largest X shape.

Assumptions

The given matrix is not null, has size of N * M, N >= 0 and M >= 0.
Examples

{ {0, 0, 0, 0},

  {1, 1, 1, 1},

  {0, 1, 1, 1},

  {1, 0, 1, 1} }

the largest X of 1s has arm length 2.

public class Solution {
  public int largest(int[][] matrix) {
    // Write your solution here.
    return 0;
  }
}



5.Largest SubMatrix Sum

Given a matrix that contains integers, find the submatrix with the largest sum.

Return the sum of the submatrix.

Assumptions

The given matrix is not null and has size of M * N, where M >= 1 and N >= 1
Examples

{ {1, -2, -1, 4},

  {1, -1,  1, 1},

  {0, -1, -1, 1},

  {0,  0,  1, 1} }

the largest submatrix sum is (-1) + 4 + 1 + 1 + (-1) + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7.


public class Solution {
  public int largest(int[][] matrix) {
    // Write your solution here.
    return 0;
  }
}
