/*
Given a series of strings, find two strings that have no common characters AND their length product is maximum.
Assumptions:

All letters in the words are from 'a-z' in ASCII
Strings are sorted by length
Average word length = m
There are n words in the dictionary

Example given:
s1: "abcde" (size = 5)
s2: "adzz" (size = 4)
s3: "abd" (size = 3)
s4: "fgz" (size = 3)
Solution shows that "abcde" × "fgz" = 5 × 3 = 15 is the answer, as these strings have no common characters and
their length product (15) is the maximum possible from the given strings.
