Q2.3 Given three arrays with numbers in ascending order. Pull one number from each array to form a coordinate <x,y,z> in a 3D space. (1) How to find the coordinates of the points that is k-th closest to <0,0,0>?

A1[m] = { 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, .... } -> X
         i

A2[n] = { 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, ....} -> Y
         j

A3[L] = { 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, ...} -> Z
         k

Solution: f = sqrt(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)
